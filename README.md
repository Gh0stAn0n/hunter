# About 'hunter'

hunter is a bash script that analyze automatically every suspicious networks live info activity's such as IPs, URLs, Domains and more using:

Automater and VirusTotal.

# Possibility and Capability

> ADVANTAGES:

- can detect malwares, viruses, suspicious activity from pcap file such as MITM or related dangerous IPs used by bots.

- will create an 'output-info file' automatically if the IP (for ex) have been stocked in the googledb as 'Dangerous'.

- check if the new supposed output file or directory is already created. (instead of :: error cant write on 'file.txt' because 'file.txt' already exist :: you'll get file.2.txt or dir.2 then .3, .4, ect...)

- check for every errors possible. (correct path, correct answers as input, if the ip choosen is truly a correct ip)

- the required dependencies and libraries will be scanned and any missing packages will be installed automatically.

- easy to use since explanations are written. ([sudo] bash / ./hunter -I)

- if you need help for the script usage, type [sudo] bash / ./hunter -h, for more details about the options.

- help and info menu doesn't require sudo privileges.


> DISADVANTAGES:

- Automater scans are very slow.
